### Screws and standoffs
|Part|Quantity|
|-----|-----|
|M2 standoff 13mm | 11 |
|M2 standoff 9mm | 10 |
|M2 screw 6mm | 21 |


### Lazer cutting

|File|Quantity|Notes|
|-----|-----|-----|
|top.dxf | 1 | |
|mid-upper.dxf | 1 | |
|mid.dxf | 3 | cutting 3 layers will result in a tight fit for the USB cable (~9 mm height). It should fit most cables, but if you are worried, you can cut another layer and replace the standoffs 9mm -> 10mm, 13mm -> 16mm |
|mid-lower.dxf | 1 | |
|bottom.dxf | 1 | |
